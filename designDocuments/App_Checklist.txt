App Checklist
-------------

I. Overall App
   1. Looks and behaves as expected between desktop and mobile, between 
      different browsers, and when window is resized
   2. Form elements always respond to user interaction even if inputs are 
      unexpected (in which case the app will provide an error messsage or 
      warning)
   3. Debugging messages do not show up in console in final version
   4. Record everything that happens when the app fails any test or responds
      in an unexpected way

II. Screen 1 (selecting refrigerant and method)
   1. Out of each set of radio buttons only one option can be selected
   2. If an option is not selected for either refrigerant or method or both 
      fields, an error message will pop up and the app does not move to the 
      next screen
   3. If user has gone back to this screen from screen 2, everything looks and 
      behaves exactly as it did the first time around
   4. Page elements do not shift out of place or "break" if radio buttons are 
      pressed or if error messages pop up.

III. Screen 2a (Superheat)
   1. Default value for "Units of Temperature" are degrees Fahrenheit and 
      default value for "Units of Pressure" are psig (PSI/gauge).
   2. When "I know my target superheat" is checked, "Condenser Air Dry-Bulb 
      Temperature" and "Return Air Wet-Bulb Temperature" fields are replaced 
      with the field "Target Superheat"
   3. When "I know my target superheat" is unchecked, the "Target Superheat"
      field is replaced with the fields "Condenser Air Dry-Bulb Temperature"
      and "Return Air Wet-Bulb Temperature"
   4. The form behaves as expected and in exactly the same way when the 
      checkbox is checked and unchecked multiple times. Page elements do not 
      shift out of place or "break" when the form fields change.
   5. The form fields are the correct ones for superheat and do not change even
      when the user clicks the "Back" button and switches between the 
      "Superheat" and "Subcooling" screens without restarting the app
   6. Numbers in the text boxes are automatically converted when new units are 
      selected. Check that the conversions are accurate.
   7. When "Calculate" button is pressed:
         a. If fields are empty or non-numeric entries are submitted, an error
            message pops up indicating this
         b. If numbers are out of range or an answer cannot be calculated for
            any reason, an error message will pop up indicating this
         c. The answer will consist of 3 sections: "Superheat",
            "Target Superheat", and a final section that indicates whether 
            refrigerant is to be added, removed, or if there is a perfect 
            amount
         d. Check that units in the answer correspond with the units selected
            by the user in the form
         e. Form still looks and behaves as expected after an answer has been
            calculated. Page elements do not shift out of place or "break" and
            all text fits within the space allowed.
   8. Check that the form gives the correct answers:
         a. Test with different units
         b. Test to see that the form gives the correct units and answers when 
            units are changed without restarting the app
         c. Test to see that the form gives the correct units and answers when 
            "I know my target superheat" is check or unchecked without 
            the app restarting the app
         d. Test to see that only the "Target Superheat" field is used in the
            calculation when "I know my target superheat" is checked, even if
            it was previously unchecked
         e. Test to see that only the "Condenser Air Dry-Bulb Temperature" and 
            "Return Air Wet-Bulb Temperature" fields are used in the 
            calculation when "I know my target superheat" is unchecked, even if
            it was previously checked
   9. After an error message or an answer appears after the "Calculate" button 
      is clicked, if the user leaves this screen by click the "Back" button and 
      returns, the answer box or the error messages will have disappeared

IV. Screen 2b (Subcooling)
   1. Default value for "Units of Temperature" are degrees Fahrenheit and 
      default value for "Units of Pressure" are psig (PSI/gauge).
   2. The form fields are the correct ones for subcooling and do not change even
      when the user clicks the "Back" button and switches between the 
      "Superheat" and "Subcooling" screens without restarting the app
   3. Numbers in the text boxes are automatically converted when new units are 
      selected. Check that the conversions are accurate.

         c. The answer will consist of 3 sections: "Subcooling",
            "Target Subcooling", and a final section that indicates whether 
            refrigerant is to be added, removed, or if there is a perfect 
            amount
         d. Check that units in the answer correspond with the units selected
