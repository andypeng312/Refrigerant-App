This is an app written when for refrigeration and HVAC technicians. A 
technician can take measurements, enter them in this app, and determine whether
refrigerant needs to be added or removed from the system.

The focus of this app was to better understand the process and the decision-
making process that technicians use in servicing refrigeration systems and to
create a bare-bones prototype of this kind of app. As a result, there is not 
much focus on aesthetics.

This app was written as a web app in HTML but mobile versions for Android and
Windows Phones were created using PhoneGap and included in the appBuilds 
folder.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PhoneGap
Estimated Lines of Code: 1600 lines (1100 of which are tabulated data)
